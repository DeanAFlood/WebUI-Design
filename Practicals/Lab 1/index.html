                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting    
                industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text   
                ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type 
                and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not  
                only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
                remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s    
                with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
                and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus       
                PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
